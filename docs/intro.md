## Welcome to LWK

**Liquid Wallet Kit (LWK)** is a modular collection of Rust crates designed for building robust Liquid Bitcoin wallets. LWK provides everything developers need to integrate Liquid functionality into their applications, from simple payment wallets to complex multi-signature systems and asset management platforms.

## What is LWK?

LWK is not a single wallet application, but rather a comprehensive **toolkit** that enables developers to build their own Liquid wallet solutions. It follows a modular architecture where each component serves a specific purpose, allowing developers to use only what they need.

### Key Design Principles

- **Modular Architecture**: Pick and choose only the components you need
- **Watch-Only Model**: Enhanced security through separation of concerns  
- **Multi-Language Support**: Native bindings for Python, Kotlin, Swift, C#, and WebAssembly
- **Hardware Integration**: First-class support for Jade and Ledger devices
- **Production Ready**: All crates are published and actively maintained

## Core Capabilities

### Wallet Operations
- Create and manage watch-only wallets using CT descriptors
- Generate receiving addresses with full confidential transaction support
- Sync with Liquid blockchain via Electrum or Esplora backends
- Build, sign, and broadcast transactions using PSET format

### Asset Management
- Issue new assets on the Liquid network
- Reissue existing assets with proper token management
- Burn assets permanently from circulation
- Transfer any Liquid asset with confidential amounts

### Security Features
- Hardware wallet integration (Jade, Ledger)
- Multi-signature wallet support
- Offline signing capabilities
- Hierarchical deterministic key derivation

### Developer Experience
- Command-line interface for testing and automation
- JSON-RPC server for easy integration
- Comprehensive language bindings
- WebAssembly support for browser applications

## Crate Status

All LWK crates are **published on crates.io** and ready for production use:
